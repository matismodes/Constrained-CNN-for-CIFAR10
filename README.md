<h1>Constrained CNN for CIFAR-10</h1>
Constrained NN Architecture for CIFAR-10 Dataset Prediction

1. Dataset:
   - The task involves the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is composed of 60,000 (3x32x32) color images, corresponding to 10 different classes (6,000 images for each).
2. Architecture:
   - The goal was to obtain the highest test score with a CNN based on a constrained architecture.
   - The constraint involved the use of a series of intermediate blocks, each made from L independent convolutional layers, and a final block at the end.
   - The layers within each intermediate block all generate an image of the same shape, this is because these layer outputs are combined into a single output image by multiplying them by coefficients and then adding them together.
   - The coefficients used for this multiplication at the end of the intermediate block, are generated by a fully-connected nn that takes as input a vector made by the averages per channel of the image that entered the respective intermediate block as input.
   - The output block receives the output image of the last intermediate block and uses the averages of this image's channels as inputs for a sequence of zero or more fully connected layers that then output the final decision vector o.
3. Results:
   - The model was trained using batches and tuned with different hyperparameter combinations.
   - The end result was a test accuracy score of 91.08%.
